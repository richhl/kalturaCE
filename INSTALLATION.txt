
Pre-Installation Considerations
********************************
Please note the following considerations before setting up your Kaltura CE v3.0

Virtual Host Setup
==================
During the installation process, Kaltura sets up the CE to run as a Virtual Host under Apache2. This makes it easier to cleanly support multiple Flash applications and streaming, and lets the various applications run from the virtual root directory regardless of their actual installation paths.
The Kaltura CE uses name-based virtual hosting under Apache2. During installation, the install script will prompt you for the domain name of your machine (or a virtual host, if you have one configured), for example: kaltura.myhost.com. After all installation steps are complete, you will launch the CE with http://kaltura.myhost.com/start.

PHP version compliance
=======================
The current version of the Kaltura CE supports both PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.2

Migration from Kaltura CE 1.5 or older
=======================================
Please note that Kaltura does not provide a complete migration path from Kaltura CE 1.5 to the current one. If you already run a live web site based on older versions of Kaltura CE, you will need to manually transfer your content and players to work with the new version of Kaltura CE. It’s possible to create a script based on the Kaltura REST API to automate this transfer process using the API’s bulkUpload method. A basic script will be provided on the Kaltura.org site.

Migration from Kaltura CE 2.0.x
=======================================
Migration instruction from Kaltura CE 2.0.x to the beta version of Kaltura CE 3.0 are not avaialble. such instructions will be provided together with the official release of Kaltura CE 3.0

Pre-distributed setup considerations
=====================================
The current Kaltura CE installation script is meant for a single server installation. However, when you’re ready to install the Kaltura CE for use in a production environment, you can take the following steps to ease platform distribution when your service scales up.
- Set up your Kaltura databases on a dedicated server within your environment.
- Use NFS to set up your storage location on a dedicated file system that can be accessed from your Kaltura server (and later all of the servers you deploy as part of your Kaltura platform setup).
- Set up your xymon monitoring server installation (optional), on a dedicated server within your environment
For more information about architecture and scaling considerations, please refer to Kaltura CE documentation at http://www.kaltura.org/kaltura-community-edition-kalturace

Getting Started
****************
Congratulations on setting up your Kaltura CE !

To get easily started with your Kaltura CE you should first become familiar with the following applications:
- Kaltura Administration Console - This is your platform administration tool, usually to be used by the system administrator/s of your Kaltura video Platform
- Kaltura Management Console (KMC) - This is the Kaltura console for content management and publishing. every publisher that is registered into your online video platform will have his/her own KMC account

To start working with the Kaltura CE, do the following:
1. Go to your local Kaltura CE start page
=======================================
To get started working with the Kaltura CE after a successful installation, browse to your local Kaltura CE start page at: http://yourdomainname/start. 
From the start page you can obtain some useful information on the Kaltura CE and the use you can make of it, as well as links to your Kaltura Admin Console application your Kaltura Management Console and to other pages in your Kaltura CE installation. Logging into your Kaltura Administration Console for creating a KMC account should be your first step for getting started with the Kaltura CE.

Log into the Kaltura Administration Console to create your first KMC account
=============================================================================
From the Kaltura Admin Console, you can create your own "Publisher KMC account" for managing your content (go to the Publisher Management >> Add New publisher page).
Complete the form with the required information and specifically set the email address of this KMC account's administrator. This email address will be used as the username for logging into the new KMC account.
Assuming your mail server is running, your KMC administrator will receive a registration confirmation notification to his mailbox with his full KMC account credentials
You can check that the new KMC account is available within the Publisher Management page, you, as the platform administrator are able to seamlessly manage all the KMC accounts that are registered within your platform from the Publisher Management page within the administration console. (select the Manage action to enter each publisher's KMC account)

Log into your new KMC account
=============================
When your KMC account administrator gets his/her new KMC account credentials, he/she can log into this account and start upload content, manage content, design and set new player widgets, set the publishing settings etc.



The direct URL to your Kaltura Management Console is http://yourdomainname/kmc
