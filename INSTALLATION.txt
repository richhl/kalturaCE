
Pre-Installation Considerations
********************************
Please note the following considerations before setting up your Kaltura On-Prem 3.0

Virtual Host Setup
==================
During the installation process, Kaltura sets up the On-Prem platform to run as a Virtual Host under Apache2. This makes it easier to cleanly support multiple Flash applications and streaming, and lets the various applications run from the virtual root directory regardless of their actual installation paths.
The Kaltura ON-Prem uses name-based virtual hosting under Apache2. During installation, the install script will prompt you for the domain name of your machine (or a virtual host, if you have one configured), for example: kaltura.myhost.com. After all installation steps are complete, you will launch the On-Prem setup from http://kaltura.myhost.com/start.

PHP version compliance
=======================
The current version of the Kaltura ON-Prem supports both PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.2

127.0.0.1  yourdomainname.com

You are directed to make this change at the end of the installation script.
This entry is needed so that Kaltura internal API client applications (e.g. the admin console application and the kaltura batch application) can be directed to the relevant Kaltura web services according to their internal 'server url' configuration.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required info during installation
***********************************
When running the Kaltura On-Prem installation script, you will be prompted to provide some information that is required for setting up and configuring your Kaltura On-Prem
Please prepare for having this information available, before you run the Kaltura On-Prem installation script.

The full pathname to your Apache apachectl script
==================================================
This information is required, so the Kaltura On-Prem installation script can verify your apache settings prerequisites. Please note the name and location of this file is different if you are using the XAMPP configuration and also has different names in different Linux distributions
For a standard XAMPP configuration the apachectl is usually located at:
/opt/lampp/bin/apachectl
For a standard LAMP configuration the apachectl may be available at one of the following paths:
/usr/bin/apachectl
/usr/bin/apache2ctl

The full pathname to your PHP binary file
==========================================
This information is required, so the Kaltura On-Prem installation script can verify your php settings prerequisites. Please note the name and location of this file is different if you are using the XAMPP configuration or not
For a standard XAMPP configuration the php binary is usually located at:
/opt/lampp/bin/php
For a standard LAMP configuration the php binary is usually available at the following path:
/usr/bin/php

The full target directory path for the Kaltura application
===========================================================
This is the directory you want the Kaltura On-Prem installation script to set your Kaltura application at. (Should not be the same as the directory to which you extracted the Kaltura On-Prem package). When this directory does not exist it will be created by the installation script. This is where you can later find all the Kaltura On-Prem application source code, scripts, configurations, logs etc. the Kaltura storgae directory will be created as well under this directory within a web subdirectory 
Example:
/opt/kaltura

Database information
====================
Database hostname, port, root user, root password
This is the access information to the MySQL database environment you want use for the Kaltura On-Prem. If you are planning to set a distributed setup you can set this database on a dedicated server that can be accessed by the Kaltura On-Prem installation.
Example:
Hostname: localhost/your db server hostname
Port: 3306
User: root
Password: root

Your primary system administrator email address
================================================
This is the email address of the person who will serve as your primary system administration for the Kaltura On-Prem. This email address will be set as the login username for the Kaltura On-Prem administration console. The person who will be assigned with this role will have full control on the video platform administration. The email address you use must be a real one, as the system will use this email address for sending system related messages.

A password to set for admin console administrator
==================================================
This is the password to your system administrator for logging into the Kaltura admin console.

The URL to your xymon - system monitoring – service (optional)
===============================================================
If you installed the xymon monitoring service prior to running the Kaltura installation script, you can provide the xymon service URL, so it will be auto-configured to become part of your Kaltura On-Prem admin console.
You can set the xymon service and it's URL also after installation has been completed. Please note that the format of this URL may be different on different Linux distributions:
Example:
http://www.xymondomain.com/xymon
http://www.xymondomain.com/hobbit

The name of the domain name/virtual hostname you will use for your kaltura On-Prem server
=====================================================================================

Getting Started
****************
Congratulations on setting up your Kaltura On-Prem!

To get easily started with your Kaltura On-Prem you should first become familiar with the following applications:
- Kaltura Administration Console - This is your platform administration tool, usually to be used by the system administrator/s of your Kaltura video Platform
- Kaltura Management Console (KMC) - This is the Kaltura console for content management and publishing. every publisher that is registered into your online video platform will have his/her own KMC account

To start working with the Kaltura On-Prem, do the following:
1. Go to your local Kaltura On-Prem start page
=======================================
To get started working with the Kaltura On-Prem after a successful installation, browse to your local Kaltura On-Prem start page at: http://yourdomainname/start. 
From the start page you can obtain some useful information on the Kaltura ON-Prem and the use you can make of it, as well as links to your Kaltura Admin Console application your Kaltura Management Console and to other pages in your Kaltura On-Prem installation. Logging into your Kaltura Administration Console for creating a KMC account should be your first step for getting started with the Kaltura On-Prem.

Log into the Kaltura Administration Console to create your first KMC account
=============================================================================
From the Kaltura Admin Console, you can create your own "Publisher KMC account" for managing your content (go to the Publisher Management >> Add New publisher page).
Complete the form with the required information and specifically set the email address of this KMC account's administrator. This email address will be used as the username for logging into the new KMC account.
Assuming your mail server is running, your KMC administrator will receive a registration confirmation notification to his mailbox with his full KMC account credentials
You can check that the new KMC account is available within the Publisher Management page, you, as the platform administrator are able to seamlessly manage all the KMC accounts that are registered within your platform from the Publisher Management page within the administration console. (select the Manage action to enter each publisher's KMC account)

Log into your new KMC account
=============================
When your KMC account administrator gets his/her new KMC account credentials, he/she can log into this account and start upload content, manage content, design and set new player widgets, set the publishing settings etc.
