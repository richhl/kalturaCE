<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The following documentation provides all of the details a web developer will need when looking to use Kaltura's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). <br/>
  Kaltura's APIs allow partners to interact with the Kaltura open source video platform through web-services. API's are based on the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> principles <br/>
  <br/>
  Each request can be an HTTP POST or GET, and the response is a gziped content (assuming that the client specified that gzip is supported)<br/>
  <br/>
  Each Kaltura API method is located at a unique URI:<br/>
  http://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/?service=<strong>[SERVICENAME]</strong>&action=<strong>[ACTIONNAME]</strong><br/>
  Where <strong>[SERVICENAME]</strong> is the name of the API service and <strong>[ACTIONNAME]</strong> is the action you would like to perform<br/><br />
  
  Note that before using the Kaltura APIs, you must
  <?php
    if (kConf::get('www_host') == 'www.kaltura.com'):
  ?>
  <a href="http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/cms/signup">apply for a Partner ID</a>. 
  <?php
    else:
  ?>
  have a Partner ID. 
  <?php
    endif;
  ?>
  If you are using the Kaltura Community Edition, this can be a local Partner ID on your server, or you may choose to create a Kaltura Partner ID, which will allow you to interact with Kaltura's system going forward as well.
