FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
**************************

WHY IS PHPMYID SO UGLY?

In a world full of CSS, embedded flash, and web based dancing balogna, it's hard
to contemplate a modern web based software package that doesn't even ship with a
logo image. Well, that's the case for phpMyID. It's about as "plain Jane" as you
can get in the looks department, and that's intentional.

The explanation is really quite simple: phpMyID isn't much to look at because,
after you install it, you really shouldn't ever need look at it again. It's not
a "destination," there's no dynamic content, and it won't attract visitors to
your site. It doesn't even sport a "powered by" footer. One of the chief design
goals for phpMyID was to keep it as light weight as possible, and designing a
landing page full of named DIVs, CSS, logos, and spacer-dot-gif files simply
isn't in line with that goal.

So, why is phpMyID "ugly?" It's not... it's spartan!


WHY ARE YOU USING (x) INSTEAD OF (y)?

I get a lot of people who write to me and ask why phpMyID works the way it does.
They're usually folks who think they know something about securiting writing
to me to complain about my using MD5, or Diffie-Hellman, HTTP Digest Auth, or
whatever the heck else for encryption/security. My answer is usually "go read
the specs." I'm not using what I'm using because it's the most secure, I'm using
it because it's what I have to use.


OKAY, BUT WHY HTTP DIGEST... YOU'RE NOT LOCKED IN THERE, ARE YOU?

HTTP Digest is a way to ensure that your password is not transmitted over the
Internet in plain text. A form based login (like, basically everything else out
there), or a Basic authentication method would not encrypt your password unless
you were using SSL and owned a certificate. HTTP Digest is an easy, guaranteed
way to ensure your password is handled in a safer way.


WHY ISN'T THERE A WEB BASED CONFIG GUI?

phpMyID is, more or less, "security" software. That being the case, I find it
essential that I do my best to ensure my users employ good security practices,
and the bottom line is that web based config tools are not secure enough. You
have to allow your web server write access to a config file, and you have to
send your credentials "over the wire" in a non-secure way to perform the setup
at all.


WHY IS GMP NOT ON BY (OR EVEN USED BY) DEFAULT?

From the GMP home page (gmplib.org):

	 GMP is very often miscompiled! We are seeing ever increasing
	problems with miscompilations of the GMP code. It has now come
	to the point where a compiler should be assumed to miscompile GMP.

That about says it all as far as I'm concerned. If you know you have a good GMP
library, you can switch it on.


WHAT ABOUT MULTIPLE USERS?

Some people like to complain that phpMyID doesn't support multiple users. No
kidding... wasn't really meant to. If you want a high power, ultra efficient
OpenID Server that people can sign up for and useses a memcached and backend
database for lightning quick transactions... go build your own.

But, if you want to support just a couple of users, you *can* do that. Just
give everyone their own unique config file. Since each file has a unique URL,
one config file per user will do the job.
