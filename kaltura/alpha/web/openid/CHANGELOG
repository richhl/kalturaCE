Version 0.9
- Bugfix: A weakness in the digest authentication method has been addressed. Thanks to forum user 'MAILER-DAEMON' for noticing.
- Bugfix: A few PHP "Notices" have been corrected. Thanks to forum users 'thomas.leplus', and 'laplix' for the patches.
-Bugfix: Paranoid mode ancestry checks did not work correctly in PHP4. Thanks to forum user 'sehrgut' for the patch.
- Bugfix: Cancel URL did not have 'openid.mode=cancel' appended to it. Thanks to forum user 'zstoichev' for noticing.
- Bugfix: Paranoid mode will not be invoked on checkid_immediate
- The Suhosin incompatibility warning can now by bypassed.
- HTML META refreshes have been replaced with HTTP 302 refreshes.

Version 0.8
- Paranoid mode was added. Users may now see and approve "trust_root" URLs that they are logging in to.
- Support was added for embedding a MicroID.
- Support was added for embedding a Pavatar. 

Version 0.7
- Bugfix: Non default query argument separators are now corrected.
- Bugfix: Internal req_url key is (again) generated using HTTP_HOST instead of
  SERVER_NAME
- Session validation was removed from the self_check routine. It's still
  conducted in the test mode. Some PHP setups had a problem with the way this
  check was conducted, but anything more complex would require too much logic
  for a lightweight self check.
- Config file now 'requires' instead of 'includes' the program file

Version 0.6
- Bugfix: client supplied non-default dh_gen and dh_modulus values were not
  being properly decoded.
- Bugfix: build_query urlencoding bug corrected.
- All references to the _GET and _POST superglobals were converted to reference
   _REQUEST.
- GMP is now supported as an alternative to bcmath.
- An internal pure-PHP big math library was added as a fallback for systems
  lacking either bcmath or GMP support.
- Default charset is now universally defined as 'iso-8859-1'.
- A 'test' mode was added to support big math library validation.
- A "robots" meta tag is now included in the default html output.
- Support for phpdoc documentation was added.
- README/FAQ docs were updated.

Version 0.5
- Enhancements have been made to allow authorization under PHP running in CGI
  mode.
- Authorization/Authentication function names have been cleaned up.
- Various warning messages have been removed.

Version 0.4
- Added support for external configuration files, and multiple user setups.
- Adjusted the idp_url parameter to remove the port number if it is a default
  value. This was necessary because some clients have decided to normalize the
  URLs they receive, and while such behavior is valid according to RFCs 2396 and
  3986, it's just a pain for me. I'd rather that all URLs be validated strictly
  as provided.

Version 0.3
- The project has been renamed to phpMyID to avoid confusion with
  www.myOpenId.com
- Fixed a bug related to the use of the 'auth-int' Digest qop. This would have
  only affected Opera users (as it's the only browser which supports auth-int).

Version 0.2
- Added support for PHP4, including a better mechanism for getting Digest
  authentication headers which should work with non-Apache servers
- Added a (hidden) logout mode, usable by calling
  MyID.php?openid.mode=logout
- Fixed a bug which occurred when associate mode was called and was unable to
  produce a secure key. Future queries from that handle would then fail
  check_authentication mode queries
- The lifetime for a smart-mode client is now same as the default cache life of
  the session minus ten seconds, which should be just under three hours
- Renamed the 'sha20' function to 'sha1_20' (to designate using 'sha1' to get
  a 20 byte hash)
- Some code and debug cleanup

Version 0.1
- Initial Release
