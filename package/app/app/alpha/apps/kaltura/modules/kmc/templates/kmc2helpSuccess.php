					<h4><span>1.5.2.1</span>Defining Rule</h4>
				</div>
				<p>In this window you can create a new rule based playlist.&nbsp; First, you need to enter a name for your playlist (required) and a description (optional).&nbsp;
							Now you need to define the actual rule that will result in your playlist content.&nbsp; You can use any number of filters: you can define a list of clips that all have the same tag (for example, if you enter the term "dog? into the search box and click search, a new rule based playlist will be created for all the clips that have the "dog? tag).&nbsp; This list will dynamically change each time a clip is added or deleted to/from your account.&nbsp; Clicking "Additional Filters" opens further filtering options including "Media Type" allowing you to select video, video mix, audio or image entries and "Duration" which allows you to filter by clip length.&nbsp; By clicking the calendar icons on the "Created between" field you can also select a date range on which to run your query.&nbsp; You can use one, several or all fields for your query.&nbsp; When more than one field is used, the logical relationship between fields is an "AND" relationship.&nbsp; The results of your filtering parameters will appear in the "Playlist result" pane.&nbsp; This way, for example, you can define a rule based playlist that consists of all the 0-4 minute video clips that were created in the past week.
							In addition to filtering, at the bottom of the window, you can define a preferred order for your playlist.&nbsp; You can order it by Most Viewed (overall, last week or last 24 hours) or Most Recent (e.g.&nbsp; most recently added to the KMC).
							If, for example, you would like to create a dynamic playlist that at any given moment consists of the most viewed clips in the last week, all you need to do is leave all the filter parameters empty, and select the "Most Viewed 7 Days? option from the "Order by? dropdown menu.&nbsp; 
							Note that on the bottom of the playlist you can see the number of entries in the playlist and their total length.&nbsp; Furthermore, you can automatically limit the number of entries that will be included in the playlist by playing with the counter positioned to the right of the "Order by? dropdown menu.
							When you are finished defining your new playlist, click the "Save? button.
							If you would like to apply more than one rule to your playlist, click the "Switch to Advanced Mode? link at the bottom of the window.&nbsp;  Note that this will clear all previous information that you have saved in your playlist.

				</div>
				<p>Changing these settings will take affect only for new content ingested (from the moment changes have been saved) and is not retroactive.</p><br />

				<p><b>Append Entry to Video Mix</b><br />
						This option by default appends new content that has been uploaded to a mix automatically so that it is ready to be displayed in the player as part of the mix.&nbsp; Selecting "False" will make the content available in the KMC but does not add the content to the mix itself.</p><br />

				<p><b>Appear in Uploader Search</b><br />
						This option allows partners to choose if the content they ingest via Kaltura is:<br />
						• Public : appears for all Kaltura partners who add Kaltura as a media source in the uploader or in any web-based Kaltura directory of content.<br />
						• Available only to your site users.<br />
						• Private:  Does not appear in searches at all.</p><br />

				<p><b>Return List of User Clips</b><br />
						This option refers to the Kaltura editor widget.&nbsp; If selected, the editor will load with both mix content clips and all previously added user clips.</p><br />

				<p><b>User Page & Media Page URL format</b><br />
						To integrate Kaltura on your site so that entry objects can be displayed in galleries, the Kaltura entry object has 2 parameters:  [partnerLandingPage][userLandingPage]
						To point to these parameters, you can do 1 of 2 things:<br />
						• Enter a base URL to which Kaltura will append the user ID/Entry ID.&nbsp; 
						• Enter the URL syntax of your choice, and make sure you add {uid} for users and {id} for entries.<br /></p><br />

				<p><b>User Upload Limit</b><br />
						By default users can upload files up to 150 MB per file.&nbsp; This can be changed here.&nbsp;  Note that users cannot upload more than 1GB, per session.&nbsp;  E.g., setting the upload limit to 100MB allows users to upload up to 10 files at a time.</p>

					<h3><span>2.4</span>TRANSCODING SETTING</h3></div>
				<p>To ensure optimal playback, source files uploaded to the system will be transcoded into multiple file flavors.<br />
						The player will automatically select the most appropriate file flavor based on multiple parameters such as the bandwidth connection of the viewer, player size, etc.<br />
						File flavors can also be used for download and syndication.&nbsp; By default, files uploaded to the system will be transcoded to the flavors selected in the main transcoding settings page - this is considered the "Default Transcoding Profile?.<br />
						Terminology:<br />
						Source file - the file uploaded as a source<br />
						Flavor - a single output file with its specific file type, bitrate, gop size, etc.&nbsp; could be either used for playback, download or editing.<br />

						For every file uploaded, the system tries to convert it to all selected default flavors.&nbsp; If the source file is in low quality, low bitrate, or small dimensions, the system will convert only to flavors that are applicable for this source file.&nbsp; For example if the file bitrate is 300 Kbps, the system will not create an additional flavor for HD (that requires over 4000 kbps).&nbsp; Transcoding only to the relevant flavors, allows you to minimize your storage requirements, and reduce storage costs.
				</p><br />

				<div class="dataTitle" id="contentSection231">
					<a href="#main">Back to top</a>
					<h4><span>2.4.1</span>Advanced Mode (multiple transcoding profiles)</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Advanced mode allows you further flexibility and control over flavors created.&nbsp; You can specify multiple conversion profiles; each transcoding profile is a group of flavors.&nbsp; For each upload session, you can select the transcoding profile to be used (done via flashvar passed to the uploader widget - KCW).&nbsp;
						   For example, a website that holds both UGC and editorial content can specify a different transcoding profile for each content type.&nbsp; UGC content will be associated with a transcoding profile that contains only a single flavor - Standard web quality.&nbsp; Editorial content will be associated with a transcoding profile that contains multiple flavors ranging from Standard quality to HD.
